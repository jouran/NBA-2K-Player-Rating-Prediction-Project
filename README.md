# NBA-2K-Player-Rating-Prediction-Project


## Introduction
We conducted text mining on comments about 2K rating from Twitter and displayed several keywords using a word cloud. As the graph indicated, most people have positive feedback such as good, best, and reasonable regarding the 2K rating. While some, on the other hand, showed opposite opinions like arguable, disrespectful, and overrating. It triggered our curiosity about how 2K came up with the rating.
For this project, we anticipated building a statistical connection between player statistics and their corresponding 2K rating using data analytics and machine learning. We took the initiative to clean data first preparing the dataset for processing, and then eliminated features with the least importance. Second, we constructed machine learning models including linear regression, KNN, Random Forest and Decision Tree, and compared pros and cons to determine the best fitting model.


## DataSet
All data were collected using web scraping from the following two websites:

## Background
NBA 2K is a series of basketball sports simulation video games developed and released annually since 1999. Each yearâ€™s game of this series emulates NBA (National Basketball Association) games. It is extremely popular among basketball fans, and it is one of the most successful and famous sports games in the world. One feature of 2K is that it would update the player rating in newly released games every year based on the performance of players in the previous season.
